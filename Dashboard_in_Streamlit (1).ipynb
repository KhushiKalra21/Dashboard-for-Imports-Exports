    "The dashboard consists of 6 interactive charts that provide key insights into international trade. Each chart uses a different variable to offer a comprehensive view of trade activities. The visualizations include a Treemap Chart, two Sunburst Charts, a Bubble Chart, and vertical and horizontal bar charts, all of which offer interactivity through dropdowns or checklists. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Each chart in the dashboard represents:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Treemap Chart** – \n",
    "- **Title**: “Product Category vs Country (Import/Export)”\n",
    "- **Variables Used**: Country, Import/Export status, Product Category.\n",
    "- **Observation**: This chart provides a visual representation of product categories traded between various countries. The size of each block represents the volume of trade for a particular product category, offering insights into which countries are importing or exporting specific product types. For example, countries like China might have a significant portion of Electronics exports, while others may dominate in Machinery imports.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1st Sunburst Chart** – \n",
    "- **Title**: “Port vs Shipping Method for Product Categories”\n",
    "- **Variables Used**: Port, Shipping Method, Product Category.\n",
    "- **Observation**: This chart displays the distribution of different product categories across various ports and shipping methods (e.g., air, sea). It helps logistics managers identify which shipping methods are predominantly used for certain products and ports. For example, the chart might show that air transport is primarily used for Electronics from specific ports, while sea transport dominates heavy goods like Machinery.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bubble Chart** – \n",
    "- **Title**: “Quantity vs Value of Trade Transactions”\n",
    "- **Variables Used**: Product Category, Quantity, Value.\n",
    "- **Observation**: The Bubble Chart illustrates the relationship between the quantity of products traded and the monetary value of these transactions. Each bubble represents a product category, with the size of the bubble corresponding to the value of the trade. This chart allows stakeholders to understand the value generated per unit quantity across product categories. It’s useful in identifying high-value, low-volume products like Electronics, as opposed to high-volume, low-value products like Clothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vertical Bar Chart** – \n",
    "- **Title**: “Trade Volume by Port (with Shipping Method Differentiation)”\n",
    "- **Variables Used**: Port, Shipping Method, Quantity.\n",
    "- **Observation**: This chart showcases the trade volume processed through different ports, with a differentiation based on shipping method (air, sea, etc.). It helps identify the most active ports and the preferred shipping methods for each port, which is valuable for optimizing logistics and managing port capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2nd Sunburst Chart** – \n",
    "- **Title**: “Country-wise Product Categories and Payment Terms”\n",
    "- **Variables Used**: Country, Product Category, Payment Terms.\n",
    "- **Observation**: This chart visualizes the distribution of payment terms across countries and product categories. It helps trade managers understand the preferred financial arrangements (e.g., Prepaid, Net 60, Cash on Delivery) by different countries and products. For instance, certain countries may predominantly opt for 'Prepaid' arrangements for electronics but 'Net 60' terms for clothing, influencing trade negotiation strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Horizontal Bar Chart** – \n",
    "- **Title**: “Country-wise Customs Code Analysis for Product Categories”\n",
    "- **Variables Used**: Country, Customs Code, Product Category.\n",
